The program can be run from the console using "java -jar QAProject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar", when in the correct directory.
When compiling the program, imports used for testing caused build errors and as such were removed from the final far jar file.

All other documentation can be found in the documentation folder including a risk assessment with a matrix, an ERD and UML diagram and a screenshot of my project management board. Completed tasks were automatically deleted from the project management board and as such are absent from the sprint.
Relevant tasks and user stories in the management board were prioritied with via the MoSCoW methodology.
